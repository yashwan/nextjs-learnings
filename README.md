Basic Concepts
	1.	React Fundamentals
	•	Components, Props, State, Lifecycle methods.
	•	Context API, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, etc.).
	2.	Introduction to Next.js
	•	Pages and Routing: File-based routing, dynamic routing, nested routes.
	•	Static and Server-Side Rendering:
	•	Static Generation (SSG): getStaticProps, getStaticPaths.
	•	Server-Side Rendering (SSR): getServerSideProps.
	•	API Routes:
	•	Creating serverless API routes.
	•	Handling requests and middleware.
	3.	Static Assets
	•	Handling images and files.
	•	Using the next/image component.
	4.	Styling
	•	CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, Styled-Components, Emotion.
	•	Theming and global styles.
	5.	Basic Deployment
	•	Deploying to platforms like Vercel or AWS.

Intermediate Concepts
	1.	State Management
	•	Context API with Next.js.
	•	Using state libraries like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Jotai.
	2.	Authentication
	•	NextAuth.js or custom authentication flow.
	•	Token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth).
	•	Session management with cookies.
	3.	Middleware and Custom Headers
	•	Middleware API in Next.js (e.g., logging, authentication checks).
	•	Setting custom HTTP headers.
	4.	Routing Techniques
	•	Dynamic routing with getStaticPaths and getServerSideProps.
	•	Middleware-based route protection and redirections.
	5.	API Integrations
	•	Integrating third-party APIs.
	•	Using GraphQL with Next.js.
	6.	Forms and Validations
	•	Using libraries like Formik, React Hook Form, and Yup for validation.
	7.	Environment Variables
	•	Using .env for secure variable handling.
	•	Accessing public and private environment variables.

Advanced Concepts
	1.	Performance Optimization
	•	Image Optimization with next/image.
	•	Code splitting, lazy loading, and dynamic imports.
	•	Analyzing the bundle size with next build and webpack-bundle-analyzer.
	•	Prefetching and caching strategies.
	2.	Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
	•	Real-time data updates with ISR (revalidate property in getStaticProps).
	3.	Advanced Server-Side Concepts
	•	Advanced SSR patterns for complex data requirements.
	•	API rate limiting and throttling (e.g., using Redis).
	•	Middleware optimizations.
	4.	Error Handling
	•	Centralized error handling for pages and APIs.
	•	Custom error pages (_error.js).
	•	Boundary error handling in React components.
	5.	File Uploads
	•	Handling file uploads using third-party services like AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Firebase.
	6.	SEO and Accessibility
	•	Meta tags with next/head.
	•	Dynamic OG meta tags and schema markup.
	•	Lighthouse accessibility and SEO checks.
	7.	CI/CD Pipelines
	•	Setting up CI/CD for Next.js projects using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
	8.	Advanced Deployment
	•	Serverless deployments (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).
	•	Self-hosting with Docker and Nginx.
	9.	Internationalization (i18n)
	•	Setting up multilingual support.
	•	Using next-i18next for translations.
	10.	Real-Time Features
	•	WebSocket integration with libraries like Socket.IO.
	•	Real-time data with serverless functions.

Expert-Level Concepts
	1.	Custom Server
	•	Building a custom Next.js server with Express, Fastify, or Koa.
	2.	Monorepo Architecture
	•	Managing Next.js in a monorepo using tools like Nx or Turborepo.
	3.	Microservices Integration
	•	Interfacing Next.js with microservices.
	•	Handling distributed architecture in the frontend.
	4.	Testing
	•	Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
	•	End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright.
	5.	Web Vitals Monitoring
	•	Monitoring Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) with tools like Vercel Analytics.
	6.	Advanced Caching
	•	Using SWR, React Query, or Apollo Client for optimized client-side caching.
	•	CDN caching strategies with Cloudflare or Fastly.
	7.	State-of-the-Art UI
	•	Building design systems with Storybook.
	•	Advanced animations with Framer Motion.
	8.	Edge Functions
	•	Using edge runtime features for ultra-low latency.
